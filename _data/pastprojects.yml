  text : Turbulent ocean models spontaneously generate a chaotic variability reaching multi­decadal/basin scales. How this low­-frequency chaos impacts climate-relevant oceanic indices is an important unsettled question. To separate this chaos from the atmospherically-forced response, MEOM and CERFACS have performed a pioneering 50-member ensemble of 1/4° global ocean/sea-ice simulations (1960-2015), which were perturbed initially but driven by the same atmospheric evolution. The results reveal the importance of the oceanic chaos, its large spatiotemporal scales, its its modulation by the atmosphere, and raise new issues about the detection/attribution of climate change in the ocean and the potential impact of this low-frequency chaos on the atmosphere.

  date : 2017-2020
  text : Our CHAOCEAN and OCCIPUT projects have shown that the turbulent ocean spontaneously generates a chaotic variability that strongly imprints all observed variables, from eddy scales to basin/multi-decadal scales. The PIRATE project (IGE, LMD, LOPS, LEGOS, CERFACS) will probabilistically characterize the imprints on observations (SLA, SST, Heat Content, MOC, etc) of this random-phase broadband “noise”, investigate its modulation by the atmosphere, and assess the representativeness of individual satellite/in-situ observations for the monitoring/reanalysis of the variability and long-term changes in the ocean. The PIRATE publications are listed in the <a href="https://meom-group.github.io/projects/occiput"> OCCIPUT webpage </a>

  date : 2017-2020
  text : MOMOMS focuses on the development of tools and methods dedicated to increase the resolution of satellite-derived SSH datasets and subsequent products. It builds upon the high expertise of researchers, engineers and students in France and Europe, covering physical oceanography, numerical oceanography, operational oceanography, data assimilation, image processing and applied mathematics.

  date : 2015-2019
  text : The vision of AtlantOS is to improve and innovate Atlantic observing by using the Framework of Ocean Observing to obtain an international, more sustainable, more efficient, more integrated, and fit-for-purpose system. Hence, the AtlantOS initiative will have a long-lasting and sustainable contribution to the societal, economic and scientific benefit arising from this integrated approach. This will be achieved by improving the value for money, extent, completeness, quality and ease of access to Atlantic Ocean data required by industries, product supplying agencies, scientist and citizens.

- title : GDRI DRAKKAR -  high-resolution global ocean/sea-ice modelling with NEMO
  image :
  date : 2014-2017
  text : DRAKKAR is a scientific and technical coordination between French research teams (LGGE-Grenoble, LPO-Brest, LOCEAN-Paris), MERCATOR-ocean, NOC Southampton, IFM-Geomar Kiel, and other  teams in Europe and Canada. We propose to design, carry out, assess, and distribute high-resolution global ocean/sea-ice numerical simulations based on the NEMO platform (www.nemo-ocean.eu) performed over long periods (five decades or more), and to improve and maintain a hierarchy of state-of-the-art ocean/sea-ice model configurations for operational and research applications.
