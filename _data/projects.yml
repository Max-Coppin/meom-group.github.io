  date : 2021-2023
  text : SEAMLESS aims at improving the current European capability to simulate and predict the state of marine ecosystems. The project focuses on state indicators that are linked to the ocean “health” (e.g. to oxygenation, acidification, eutrophication), “services” (e.g. to sustainable aquaculture) and “response” to climate change (e.g. to the transfer of carbon in the ocean depths).

- title : CONTaCTS - Consistent OceaN Turbulence for Climate Simulators
  image :
  date : 2019-2024
  text : The "Consistent OceaN Turbulence for ClimaTe Simulators" project aims to characterize and quantify the influence of sub-mesoscale oceanic motions (scales of about 10km) on larger-scale oceanic dynamics, up to the scale of oceanic basins. A major goal of this research is to parameterize this missing influence in numerical ocean models that do not resolve sub-mesoscale motions, and that will be used for tomorrow's IPCC climate projections.

- title : IMMERSE - Improving Ocean Models for the Copernicus Programme
  image :
  date : 2018-2022
  text : Our project aims to prepare numerical ocean models for the next generation Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). In response to the future priorities for CMEMS, IMMERSE will develop new capabilities to enable the production of ocean forecasts and analyses that exploit upcoming high resolution satellite datasets; deliver ocean analyses and forecasts with the higher spatial resolution and additional process complexity demanded by users; exploit the opportunities of new high performance computing (HPC) technology; allow easy interfacing of CMEMS products with detailed local coastal models. These developments will be delivered in the NEMO ocean model, an established, world-class ocean modelling system that already forms the basis of the majority of CMEMS analysis and forecast products.

  date : 2018-2021
  text : The goal of BOOST-SWOT is to design new algorithms able to provide altimetry-derived SSH gridded products resolving at least the upper spectrum of the sub-mesoscale dynamics (> 50 km), incorporating SWOT data expected in 2021.

- title : Ocean modelling and data assimilation for SWOT mission - Preparing the inversion of SWOT data.
  image :
  date : 2017-2020
  text : The Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission will provide observations of sea surface height and surface roughness at scales <100 km, therefore opening the way for the systematic study of ocean turbulence down to the sub-mesoscales. The mission is in particular expected to yield a breakthrough in our understanding of energy pathways toward small scales in the global ocean and of the vertical exchanges between the surface layers and the ocean interior.
