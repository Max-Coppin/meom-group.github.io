A new project coordinated by IGE and led by Pierre Rampal (MEOM) has begun in 2021 : the Scale Aware Sea Ice Project (SASIP)
It involves 10 international partners from France, Norway, US, Italy, UK and Germany. 

It aims at better understanding the impact of amplified warming in polar regions, through the development of a new sea ice modelling paradigm.
